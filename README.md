- I'm @Busyflytrap. 
Unfortunately not a developer or cybersecurity expert. 
Could better knowledge of either have helped protect my devices and me 
from what appears to be a 0-click exploit? 
I registered here because much of Emvondy's posted analytics were very similar 
to mine. 
If it's not a 0-click exploit, could it be unauthorized illicit MDM? 
Any input appreciated.
